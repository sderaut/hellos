These are just some hello world programs.

They've all been manually tested to run. That's the point of hello world programs. Sometimes getting a programming language running as far as "hello world" is half the battle of starting to use it.

#### Languages covered here so far:

+ C : hello.c
+ Python 3 : hello.py
+ Java : HelloTemplate.java
