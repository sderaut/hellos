This file is the "LICENSE" for my repo "hellos" on GitHub.

I didn't know I would need a license for this. I was told that a public repository on GitHub would be free.

Now I'm supposed to read legal documents and instructions for who knows how long, a few hours, until I can write or get a license somehow? Forget it. This is the license because I named it that. It's a license for everyone, and you're welcome.
